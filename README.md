> Lightweight runtime for deployable sub-agents that need to access internal systems, run deep in your infrastructure, and integrate seamlessly with your existing deployment processes.

Station is purpose-built for **deployable sub-agents** - the intelligent automation you need for infrastructure monitoring, deployment pipelines, security scanning, and day-to-day tasks that require secure access to internal systems.

## Why Station Exists

When you need agents for internal work, you need more than application-focused agent platforms. You need:

- **Secure Internal Access** - Agents that can safely handle database credentials, API keys, and system-level access
- **Versionable Deployment** - Deployable agents that integrate with your existing deployment pipelines  
- **Team-Approved Tools** - Easy way to use and share the tools your team builds and approves
- **Low Footprint Runtime** - Lightweight system that blends into your infrastructure without overhead

**Station provides exactly this** - a lightweight, secure runtime specifically designed for deployable sub-agents.

## Core Value: Secure Deployable Sub-Agent Runtime

### üß™ **Interactive Development Playground**

**NEW**: Station now includes a powerful interactive development environment powered by Firebase Genkit:

```bash
genkit start -- stn develop --env dev
```

This launches a complete browser-based development playground where you can:
- **Test agents interactively** with custom task inputs
- **Debug tool calling** with real-time execution traces  
- **Access all MCP tools** from your environment
- **Iterate on prompts** with live reloading
- **Analyze execution flows** with detailed logging

Perfect for developing and testing agents before deployment.

### üîß **Purpose-Built for Internal Tasks**

Unlike application-focused agent platforms, Station is designed for deployable sub-agents that need to:

- Access internal databases with production credentials
- Monitor infrastructure and alert on issues
- Automate deployment pipelines with CI/CD system access
- Perform security scans with elevated permissions
- Handle incident response with system-level tools

### üîê **Security by Design**

- **Self-Hosted** - Complete data sovereignty, no external dependencies beyond AI providers
- **Encrypted Secrets** - AES encryption for credentials and sensitive configuration
- **Environment Isolation** - Separate execution contexts for dev/staging/prod
- **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of agent deployments and executions

### ‚ö° **Lightweight & Integrated**

- **Single 45MB Binary** - No complex infrastructure or dependencies
- **SQLite Database** - Zero-setup local development, PostgreSQL for production
- **GitOps Ready** - Version-controlled agent configurations like infrastructure code
- **Existing Toolchain** - Uses your team's approved MCP tools and integrations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Station
```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station
cd station && go build -o stn ./cmd/main

# Binary install
curl -sSL https://getstation.cloudshipai.com | bash
```

### 2. Initialize & Configure Tools
```bash
# Initialize runtime
stn init

# Load operational tools (two-step process)
stn load examples/mcps/aws-cli.json
stn load examples/mcps/database-postgres.json
stn load examples/mcps/slack.json

# Sync configurations to keep tools up-to-date
stn sync production
```

### 3. Create Deployable Sub-Agents
```bash
# Create a database monitoring agent
stn agent create \
  --name "Database Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor production database health and alert on issues"

# Create an infrastructure deployment agent  
stn agent create \
  --name "Deploy Pipeline" \
  --description "Automated deployment pipeline with rollback capability"

# Test locally
stn agent run 1 "Check database connection pool and alert if over 80% capacity"
```

### 4. Deploy with Version Control
```bash
# Export agents as versioned templates
stn agent export 1 ./ops-agents/db-monitor
stn agent export 2 ./ops-agents/deploy-pipeline

# Version control like infrastructure code
git add ops-agents/
git commit -m "Add production database monitoring agent"
git push origin main

# Deploy to production with encrypted secrets
stn template install ./ops-agents/db-monitor
```

### 5. Use as MCP Server (Optional)
```bash
# Use Station as MCP server for other AI applications
# Add to your MCP client config (e.g., Claude Desktop):
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stn": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}

# Then access Station agents from any MCP-compatible AI application
# Available tools: call_agent, create_agent, list_agents, discover_tools
```

## Deployable Sub-Agent Use Cases

### **Infrastructure Monitoring**
```bash
# Database health monitoring with production credentials
stn agent create --name "DB Health Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor connection pools, query performance, disk usage"

# System resource monitoring across environments  
stn agent create --name "Resource Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor CPU, memory, disk across development and production"
```

### **Deployment Automation**
```bash
# CI/CD pipeline integration
stn agent create --name "Deployment Pipeline" \
  --description "Automated deployments with health checks and rollback"

# Infrastructure as Code management
stn agent create --name "Terraform Manager" \
  --description "Plan, apply, and manage infrastructure changes"
```

### **Security Operations**
```bash
# Vulnerability scanning and alerting
stn agent create --name "Security Scanner" \
  --description "Scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues"

# Access monitoring and incident response
stn agent create --name "Incident Responder" \
  --description "Automated incident detection and initial response"
```

## MCP Tool Integration

Station includes **20+ production-ready tools for sub-agents**:

| **Operations** | **Tools** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | AWS CLI, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, SSH |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana, System metrics, Log analysis |
| **Communication** | Slack, PagerDuty, Email, Webhook notifications |
| **Security** | Vault, Certificate management, Access control |
| **Files** | Local files, Network storage, Configuration management |

```bash
# Load toolchains for sub-agents (two-step process)
stn load examples/mcps/infrastructure-suite.json
stn sync production  # Keep configurations in sync

# Load monitoring and alerting tools
stn load examples/mcps/monitoring-stack.json  
stn sync production

# Load security and compliance tools
stn load examples/mcps/security-tools.json
stn sync production
```

### **Using Station as an MCP Server**

Station can also be used as a standalone MCP server for other AI applications and frameworks. This allows you to integrate Station's agent management capabilities with any MCP-compatible system.

#### **MCP Configuration**

Add Station to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop, other MCP clients):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stn": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": [
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Available MCP Tools**

When running as an MCP server, Station provides these tools:

- **Agent Management**: `call_agent`, `create_agent`, `list_agents`, `get_agent_details`
- **Tool Discovery**: `discover_tools`, `list_tools`, `list_mcp_configs`
- **Environment Management**: `list_environments`
- **System Integration**: Access to all configured MCP tools across environments

#### **Example Usage**

```bash
# Start Station MCP server in stdio mode
stn stdio

# The server provides tools like:
# - call_agent: Execute any Station agent with a task
# - create_agent: Create new agents with specific tools
# - list_agents: Browse available agents across environments
# - discover_tools: Find available tools in your Station setup
```

This makes Station a powerful backend for AI applications that need access to your internal tools and agents while maintaining security and environment isolation.
