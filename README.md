# Station - Self-Hosted MCP Agent Runtime

**Station** is a lightweight, self-hosted runtime for executing background AI agents within your infrastructure. Deploy a single 40MB binary to run scheduled Claude/LLM agents that can access your internal tools, APIs, and environments without exposing credentials to third-party services.

## Problem

Engineering teams want to leverage AI agents for operational tasks (monitoring, automation, alerting) but face a critical blocker: there's no secure way to give AI agents access to production infrastructure without handing over the keys to external services.

## Solution

Station acts as a secure bridge between your AI (Claude, GPT, etc.) and your infrastructure. You deploy Station inside your network, configure it with your tools and credentials, then use natural language to create agents that run on your schedule with your permissions.

## How It Works

```
Your LLM (Claude) → MCP Protocol → Station (in your infra) → Your Tools
                                         ↓
                              Self-Bootstrapping Agents
                              (intelligent tool selection)
```

1. **Deploy Station** in your infrastructure (single binary, 40MB)
2. **Load MCP tools** for your environments (filesystem, GitHub, AWS, etc.)
3. **Use Station's own MCP** - Station provides its own MCP server via stdio
4. **Create agents intelligently** - Station uses AI to analyze and assign optimal tools
5. **Agents execute via self-bootstrapping** - Station manages itself using its own MCP server

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Station (30 seconds)
```bash
# Build from source (until binary releases are available)
git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station
cd station
go build -o stn cmd/stn/main.go

# Initialize with encryption keys and sane defaults
./stn init
```

### 2. Load Your Tools (2 minutes)
```bash
# Create environments
./stn env create development
./stn env create staging

# Load filesystem tools for local file operations
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user"]
    }
  }
}' > mcp.json
./stn load --config-name "filesystem-tools"

# Load GitHub tools for repository management
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}' > mcp.json
./stn load --config-name "github-tools"
```

### 3. Create and Run Agents (1 minute)
```bash
# Create an intelligent filesystem analyzer agent
./stn agent create "filesystem-analyzer" "Analyze directory structures and file contents for code review" --domain "devops"

# Create a GitHub repository manager
./stn agent create "github-reviewer" "Review pull requests and manage GitHub repository tasks" --domain "software-engineering"

# Run agents with self-bootstrapping execution
./stn agent run 1 "List the allowed directories and analyze their structure"
./stn agent run 2 "List available GitHub management tools"

# View execution results
./stn runs list
./stn runs inspect 1
```

Station's **Self-Bootstrapping Intelligence**:
- ✅ **AI-Driven Tool Selection**: Genkit analyzes requirements and assigns optimal tools
- ✅ **Intelligent Agent Creation**: Station uses its own MCP server to create agents  
- ✅ **Self-Managing Architecture**: Station manages itself via stdio MCP
- ✅ **Context-Aware Execution**: Complex tasks get more iterations, simple tasks stay efficient
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with OpenAI (supports Ollama/Gemini too)

## Key Features

### 🔐 Security First
- **Zero credential exposure**: All secrets stay in your infrastructure
- **Encrypted storage**: MCP configs encrypted at rest with NaCl
- **Fine-grained permissions**: Control exactly which sub-tools agents can access
- **Environment isolation**: Separate configs for dev/staging/prod

### 🎯 Practical Design
- **Single binary**: 40MB, no dependencies, runs anywhere
- **Self-bootstrapping**: Station uses its own MCP server for intelligent agent management
- **AI-powered tool selection**: Genkit analyzes requirements and selects optimal tools
- **Multi-provider AI support**: OpenAI (default), Ollama, Gemini with smart fallbacks
- **Context-aware execution**: Dynamic iteration limits (5→25) based on task complexity
- **Tool discovery**: Analyzes GitHub repos to auto-configure MCP servers
- **Webhook notifications**: Real-time notifications when agents complete tasks
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry compatible for standard monitoring

### 🚀 Real Use Cases

**Intelligent Code Analysis**
```bash
./stn agent create "code-analyzer" "Analyze codebase structure, identify patterns, and suggest improvements" --domain "software-engineering"
./stn agent run 1 "Analyze this project directory and provide insights about the codebase organization"
```
*→ AI selects filesystem tools, determines optimal steps (10-25 iterations), provides professional analysis*

**Multi-Repository Management**
```bash  
./stn agent create "repo-manager" "Monitor pull requests, review code, and manage GitHub workflows" --domain "devops"
./stn agent run 2 "List open pull requests and provide status summary with recommendations"
```
*→ Station intelligently assigns GitHub tools, handles complex multi-step workflows*

**Self-Bootstrapping Development**
```bash
# Station creates agents using its own MCP server - truly self-managing!
./stn stdio  # Station's own MCP server
# In another terminal:
./stn agent create "meta-agent" "Create and manage other agents based on requirements" --domain "ai-ops"
```
*→ Self-referential AI system that can evolve and improve itself*

2. **Tool Analysis**: Genkit analyzes available tools and selects optimal combinations  
3. **Intelligent Execution**: Dynamic iteration limits based on task complexity
4. **Self-Management**: Station manages itself through its own MCP interface

stn webhook create --name "Slack Alerts" \
  --url "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK" \
  --events "agent_run_completed" \
  --secret "your-webhook-secret"

# List and manage webhooks
stn webhook list
stn webhook show <webhook-id>
stn webhook deliveries  # View delivery history
```

**Webhook Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "event": "agent_run_completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "agent": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "CloudWatch Monitor",
    "environment_id": 1
  },

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Environment Sync
```bash
# Load same tool across environments with different credentials
for env in dev stage prod; do
  stn load github-mcp.json --env $env
done
```

### Monitoring Pipeline
```bash
# Chain multiple tools for complex workflows
"Monitor Datadog → Analyze with AWS → Create Jira ticket → Notify Slack"
```

### Scheduled Reports
```bash
# Daily/weekly operational intelligence
"Every Monday at 9am, gather metrics from all environments and 
create an executive summary with trends and recommendations"
```

### Webhook Integration Patterns
```bash
# Connect Station to your existing tools
stn webhook create --name "PagerDuty" --url "https://events.pagerduty.com/integration/xxx/enqueue"
stn webhook create --name "DataDog" --url "https://webhooks.datadoghq.com/v1/webhooks/xxx"
stn webhook create --name "Custom Dashboard" --url "https://dashboard.company.com/api/station-events"

# Chain webhooks for complex workflows
# Agent completes → Webhook → Triggers deployment → Another agent validates
```

## Troubleshooting

**Agent execution failing?**
```bash
# Check recent runs and their details
./stn runs list
./stn runs inspect <run-id>

# View agent configuration
./stn agent list
```

**No tools available?**
```bash
# Check loaded MCP servers and their tools
./stn mcp list
./stn mcp tools

# Load filesystem tools for testing
echo '{"mcpServers":{"filesystem":{"command":"npx","args":["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","/home/user"]}}}' > mcp.json
./stn load --config-name "test-tools"
```

**Can't create agents?**
```bash
# Test stdio MCP server (Station's self-bootstrapping)
./stn stdio &  # Start in background
./stn agent create "test-agent" "Simple test agent" --domain "testing"
```

**Environment issues?**
```bash
# Check environments and their status
./stn env list
./stn config show

# Verify initialization worked
ls ~/.config/station/
```

## CloudshipAI Integration

Station integrates with [CloudshipAI](https://cloudship.ai) for fleet management:

```bash
# Connect Station to Cloudship fleet
stn cloudship connect --fleet-id xxx

# Cloudship can now orchestrate agents across all your Stations
# Perfect for multi-region, multi-cloud, edge deployments
```
