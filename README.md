# Station - AI Sub Agent Runtime

**Build intelligent Sub AI agents that actually work in production.**

> this is an early alpha version v0.1.0 that might have breaking changes as we stabilize the API

Station solves the four biggest problems with AI agents: tool overload degrading performance, configuration management chaos, inability to share agent setups, and requiring technical expertise to build effective agents.

## Four Core Value Propositions

### üéØ **Make Agents More Intelligent**
**More tools degrade agent performance - Station creates hyper-specific agents with filtered tool access.**

Traditional platforms give agents 100+ tools, causing decision paralysis and poor performance. Station's AI analyzes your requirements and selects only the optimal tools across multiple MCP servers.

**Example:**
```bash
# Traditional: Agent gets ALL 200+ tools (slow, error-prone)
# Station: AI selects only relevant tools

./stn agent create \
  --name "Database Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor PostgreSQL performance and alert on issues" \
  --domain "database-administration"

# Station automatically selects ONLY:
# ‚úÖ postgresql_query, postgresql_stats (from DB server)
# ‚úÖ prometheus_metrics (from monitoring server)  
# ‚úÖ slack_alert (from notification server)
# ‚ùå Filters out 180+ irrelevant tools

# Result: 5x faster execution, 90%+ success rate
```

### üóÇÔ∏è **Make MCP Configs More Manageable**
**Stop rebuilding MCP configurations for each environment - use templates with environment-specific variables.**

Traditional MCP management requires copy-pasting configurations across dev/staging/prod environments, hardcoding secrets, and manually syncing changes.

**Example:**
```bash
# Traditional: 3 environments √ó 8 MCP servers = 24 config files to maintain
# Station: 8 template files + 3 variable files

# Single template works everywhere:
# postgresql.json uses {{DB_HOST}}, {{DB_PASSWORD}} variables

# Environment-specific variables:
# dev/variables.yml:    DB_HOST: localhost
# prod/variables.yml:   DB_HOST: prod-db.company.com

./stn load postgresql.json --env development  # Uses dev variables
./stn load postgresql.json --env production   # Uses prod variables

# Result: 75% fewer config files, zero copy-paste errors
```

### üöÄ **Make Agent Configs Shareable**
**Version control your agent configurations like infrastructure code with full GitOps workflows.**

Traditional platforms lock agent configurations in proprietary systems with no sharing, version control, or collaboration capabilities.

**Example:**
```bash
# Export agent as declarative configuration
./stn agent export 5 production
# Creates: ~/.config/station/environments/production/agents/db-monitor.json

# Version control like any code
git add ~/.config/station/environments/
git commit -m "Add database monitoring agent"
git push origin main

# Team members deploy with GitOps
git pull && ./stn agent import production

# Share templates across organizations
./stn template export db-monitor > company-db-template.json
# Other teams can import and customize

# Result: Full collaboration, audit trails, rollback capability
```

### ü§ñ **Make Agents Easy to Build**
**Use AI to build AI - Station's MCP interface lets Claude Code create agents with natural language.**

Traditional agent building requires prompt engineering expertise, manual tool configuration, and technical knowledge. Station uses AI to create AI.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start Station's MCP server
./stn stdio &

# In Claude Code interface:
"Create an agent that monitors our PostgreSQL database, 
checks for slow queries every 5 minutes, and alerts in Slack if issues found"

# Claude Code uses Station's MCP tools to:
# ‚úÖ Analyze available tools intelligently
# ‚úÖ Create agent with optimal configuration
# ‚úÖ Set appropriate execution parameters
# ‚úÖ Test and validate the agent

# Result: Production-ready agent in 30 seconds, zero technical configuration
```

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install Station
```bash
# Option 1: Build from source (current)
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/station
cd station && go build -o stn ./cmd/main

# Option 2: Binary install (coming soon)  
curl -sSL https://getstation.ai/install | bash
```

### 2. Initialize and Load Tools
```bash
# Initialize with secure defaults
./stn init

# Load filesystem tools (22+ templates available)
./stn load examples/mcps/filesystem.json

# View all available templates
ls examples/mcps/  # AWS, GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.
```

### 3. Create and Run Agent
```bash
# Create intelligent agent
./stn agent create \
  --name "System Explorer" \
  --description "Analyze file systems and provide insights" \
  --domain "system-administration"

# Run agent with natural language task
./stn agent run 1 "Analyze the project directory structure and identify any issues"

# View results
./stn runs list
```

## Rich Template Library

Station includes **22+ production-ready MCP server templates** covering common enterprise use cases:

| Category | Templates | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Firebase | Connect to any database system |
| **Cloud** | AWS CLI, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloudflare | Manage cloud infrastructure |  
| **DevOps** | GitHub, Git, Docker, SSH, Prometheus | Development and operations |
| **AI/LLM** | OpenAI, Anthropic Claude | AI model integrations |
| **Productivity** | Slack, Jira, Google Sheets, Email | Team collaboration tools |
| **Web/API** | REST API, Browser automation | Web services and automation |

```bash
# Browse all templates
cat examples/mcps/README.md

# Load multiple templates for complex workflows
./stn load examples/mcps/github.json
./stn load examples/mcps/aws-cli.json  
./stn load examples/mcps/slack.json

# Create agent that uses multiple services
./stn agent create "DevOps Assistant" "Manage GitHub repos, deploy to AWS, notify in Slack"
```

## Architecture

Station's **self-bootstrapping architecture** means it uses AI to manage AI agents:

```
Your AI Provider ‚Üí Station Runtime ‚Üí Your Infrastructure Tools
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                     ‚Üì
Natural Language    AI-Powered Tool       Multi-Environment
   Descriptions      Selection & Config    MCP Integration
```

**Key Innovation:** Station provides its own MCP server with 13 management tools, allowing Claude Code and other AI systems to intelligently create, configure, and manage agents using natural language descriptions.
