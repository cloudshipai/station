> Lightweight runtime for deployable sub-agents that need to access internal systems, run deep in your infrastructure, and integrate seamlessly with your existing deployment processes.

Station is purpose-built for **deployable sub-agents** - the intelligent automation you need for infrastructure monitoring, deployment pipelines, security scanning, and day-to-day tasks that require secure access to internal systems.

## Why Station Exists

When you need agents for internal work, you need more than application-focused agent platforms. You need:

- **Secure Internal Access** - Agents that can safely handle database credentials, API keys, and system-level access
- **Versionable Deployment** - Deployable agents that integrate with your existing deployment pipelines  
- **Team-Approved Tools** - Easy way to use and share the tools your team builds and approves
- **Low Footprint Runtime** - Lightweight system that blends into your infrastructure without overhead

**Station provides exactly this** - a lightweight, secure runtime specifically designed for deployable sub-agents.

## Core Value: Secure Deployable Sub-Agent Runtime

### üîß **Purpose-Built for Internal Tasks**

Unlike application-focused agent platforms, Station is designed for deployable sub-agents that need to:

- Access internal databases with production credentials
- Monitor infrastructure and alert on issues
- Automate deployment pipelines with CI/CD system access
- Perform security scans with elevated permissions
- Handle incident response with system-level tools

### üîê **Security by Design**

- **Self-Hosted** - Complete data sovereignty, no external dependencies beyond AI providers
- **Encrypted Secrets** - AES encryption for credentials and sensitive configuration
- **Environment Isolation** - Separate execution contexts for dev/staging/prod
- **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of agent deployments and executions

### ‚ö° **Lightweight & Integrated**

- **Single 45MB Binary** - No complex infrastructure or dependencies
- **SQLite Database** - Zero-setup local development, PostgreSQL for production
- **GitOps Ready** - Version-controlled agent configurations like infrastructure code
- **Existing Toolchain** - Uses your team's approved MCP tools and integrations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Station
```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station
cd station && go build -o stn ./cmd/main

# Binary install (coming soon)
curl -sSL https://getstation.ai/install | bash
```

### 2. Initialize & Configure Tools
```bash
# Initialize runtime
stn init

# Load operational tools (two-step process)
stn load examples/mcps/aws-cli.json
stn load examples/mcps/database-postgres.json
stn load examples/mcps/slack.json

# Sync configurations to keep tools up-to-date
stn sync production
```

### 3. Create Deployable Sub-Agents
```bash
# Create a database monitoring agent
stn agent create \
  --name "Database Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor production database health and alert on issues"

# Create an infrastructure deployment agent  
stn agent create \
  --name "Deploy Pipeline" \
  --description "Automated deployment pipeline with rollback capability"

# Test locally
stn agent run 1 "Check database connection pool and alert if over 80% capacity"
```

### 4. Deploy with Version Control
```bash
# Export agents as versioned templates
stn agent export 1 ./ops-agents/db-monitor
stn agent export 2 ./ops-agents/deploy-pipeline

# Version control like infrastructure code
git add ops-agents/
git commit -m "Add production database monitoring agent"
git push origin main

# Deploy to production with encrypted secrets
stn template install ./ops-agents/db-monitor production \
  --vars-file secrets/production.enc
```

## Deployable Sub-Agent Use Cases

### **Infrastructure Monitoring**
```bash
# Database health monitoring with production credentials
stn agent create --name "DB Health Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor connection pools, query performance, disk usage"

# System resource monitoring across environments  
stn agent create --name "Resource Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor CPU, memory, disk across development and production"
```

### **Deployment Automation**
```bash
# CI/CD pipeline integration
stn agent create --name "Deployment Pipeline" \
  --description "Automated deployments with health checks and rollback"

# Infrastructure as Code management
stn agent create --name "Terraform Manager" \
  --description "Plan, apply, and manage infrastructure changes"
```

### **Security Operations**
```bash
# Vulnerability scanning and alerting
stn agent create --name "Security Scanner" \
  --description "Scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues"

# Access monitoring and incident response
stn agent create --name "Incident Responder" \
  --description "Automated incident detection and initial response"
```

## Agent Templates for Teams

### **Template Structure**
```
ops-agents/database-monitor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bundle/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json         # MCP dependencies and metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.json           # Agent configuration with variables
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.schema.json # Variable validation schema
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development.json     # Dev environment values

# Team members deploy with their environment variables
stn template install ./team-agents/db-monitor staging \
  --vars-file ~/.station/secrets/staging.enc

# Invoke and trigger remote sub-agents via API or MCP
curl -X POST https://station.company.com/api/v1/agents/3/execute \
  -d '{"task": "Check database health and alert if issues found"}'

# Or trigger via MCP from other agents
stn agent run 5 "Coordinate with database monitor agent to run health check"
```
