> Station is an MCP runtime that augments your Claude Code and Cursor development experience by providing an agnostic runtime for your sub-agents - with centralized management, environment isolation, and server deployment capabilities.

---

Station is purpose-built for **deployable sub-agents** - to bring intelligence in tough to reach places. Made for engineering teams that want to own and control AI agents across their environments. Station provides a framework and lifecycle to go from local to server deployments. Versioned user agents and tools opens the possibility for more intelligent infrastructure, deployments, security, background processes, and day-to-day tasks that require secure access to internal systems.

---


## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Platform Overview

### **Environment Management**
Station provides a clean web interface for managing your AI agents across different environments:

![Default Environment](./assets/default-environment.png)

### **Specialized Agent Examples** 
Pre-built agents for common DevOps workflows, like this Terraform quality analysis agent:

![Terraform Quality Agent](./assets/terraform-quality-agent.png)

## Getting Started

### 1. **Initialize Station**
```bash
stn init
```

### 2. **Copy MCP Configuration** 
Copy a filesystem template to get started:
```bash
# Create the template.json config file
cat > ~/.config/station/environments/default/template.json << 'EOF'
{
  "description": "Essential filesystem operations with MCP server integration",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", 
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest",
        "{{ .ROOT_PATH }}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "name": "filesystem-updated"
}
EOF


# Interactively fill in the variables 
stn sync 
# stn sync will detect unresolved variables and prompt you to fill them in


# Automatically set the the ROOT_PATH variable
echo "ROOT_PATH: $HOME/projects" > ~/.config/station/environments/default/variables.yml
```

### 3. **Sync Configuration**
```bash
# stn sync <environment> 
# defaults to default environment

stn sync

#stn sync development
```

### 4. **Connect to Claude or Cursor**
Add Station as an MCP server in your Claude Desktop or Cursor configuration:

**Claude Desktop (`~/.claude_desktop_config.json`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor (`.cursorrules`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. **Access Web Interface**
```bash
when connected to an LLM, station runs the web app
```

Then open **http://localhost:8585** in your browser for the full Station management interface.

## Station Bundles - Portable AI Environments

Station bundles are pre-configured environment packages that contain specialized AI agents, MCP tools, and complete workflows ready for immediate deployment.

### üöÄ **Quick Install from Registry**

Install production-ready bundles from the [Station Registry](https://cloudshipai.github.io/registry):

```bash
# Install DevOps Security Bundle via UI
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:8585/bundles
# 2. Paste URL: https://github.com/cloudshipai/registry/releases/latest/download/devops-security-bundle.tar.gz
# 3. Select environment name and click "Install"

# Or install via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8585/bundles/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bundle_location": "https://github.com/cloudshipai/registry/releases/latest/download/devops-security-bundle.tar.gz",
    "environment_name": "security-env",
    "source": "remote"
  }'
```

The DevOps Security Bundle includes:
- **Security Scanner Agent** - Comprehensive vulnerability scanning with Checkov tools
- **Terraform Auditor Agent** - Infrastructure as Code validation with TFLint
- **16 Security Tools** - Ready-to-use tools for CI/CD security automation

### üì¶ **Creating Your Own Bundles**

Turn any environment into a shareable bundle:

```bash
# Method 1: CLI Command (Recommended)
stn bundle my-environment --output my-custom-bundle.tar.gz

# Method 2: MCP Tools (For Claude Code/AI)
create_bundle_from_environment(environmentName="my-environment", outputPath="./bundle.tar.gz")

# Method 3: API Integration  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8585/api/v1/bundles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"environment_name": "my-environment", "output_path": "./bundle.tar.gz"}'
```

### üîÑ **Bundle Structure**

Station bundles use a simple, API-compatible format:
```
bundle.tar.gz
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                    # Agent definition files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Scanner.prompt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Terraform Auditor.prompt  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ship-security.json         # MCP server configurations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other-tools.json          # Additional MCP configs
```

### üõ† **CI/CD Integration**

Use bundles in your CI/CD pipelines with Docker:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions with Station Bundle
- name: Security Analysis
  run: |
    docker run \
      -v $(pwd):/workspace:ro \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} \
      -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=${{ secrets.STATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY }} \
      epuerta18/station-default:latest \
      bash -c "
        stn agent run 'Security Scanner' 'Analyze /workspace for vulnerabilities'
        stn agent run 'Terraform Auditor' 'Validate Terraform in /workspace'
      "
```

## What is a Deployable Sub-Agent?

A sub-agent is simple: **a .prompt file + MCP tools**. Everything you need is in the dotprompt.

dotprompts have the ability to define both system prompt and user prompt in the same file, making this perfect to share and easy to test. 

It also supports rich variable schema with Picoschema style 



### **Example: A Real Sub-Agent**

Here's `TestAgent.prompt` from our environment:

```yaml
---
model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
config:
  temperature: 0.3
  max_tokens: 2000
input:
  schema:
    userInput: string
output:
  schema:
    response: string
metadata:
  name: "helper"
  description: "A general-purpose helper agent for common tasks and assistance"
  version: "1.0.0"
station:
  execution_metadata:
    max_steps: 5
    environment: "default"
    agent_id: 1
    created_at: "2025-08-18T17:19:22Z"
    updated_at: "2025-08-18T17:19:22Z"

### Example with more dynamic input schema 

A planning agent that defines variables in the system prompt. These are fed at runtime via MCP, API, CLI

```yaml

  ---
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  config:
    temperature: 0.3
    max_tokens: 2000
  input:
    schema:
      userInput: string
      project_type: string
      scope: string
      timeline: string
      priority: string
      budget: string
  output:
    schema:
      response: string
  metadata:
    name: "planner"
    description: "A versatile planning agent that can create structured plans for various
  types of projects and tasks"
    version: "1.0.0"
  station:
    execution_metadata:
      max_steps: 5
      environment: "default"
      agent_id: 3
      created_at: "2025-08-18T17:30:17Z"
      updated_at: "2025-08-18T17:30:17Z"
  ---

  {{role "system"}}

  {{role "user"}}
  {{userInput}}
```

That's it. **Agent defined, tools assigned, ready to deploy.**

## Environment Organization

Station organizes everything by **environment** (dev/staging/production):

```
~/.config/station/environments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TestAgent.prompt
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SecurityScanner.prompt
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DatabaseMonitor.prompt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.json        # MCP server configs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.yml        # Environment-specific variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.json
```

## Templated MCP Configurations

MCP servers are configured with templates so you can share and install them:

**Example: `template.json`**
```json
{
  "description": "Essential filesystem operations with MCP server integration",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", 
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest",
        "{{ .ROOT_PATH }}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "name": "filesystem-updated"
}
```

**Environment Variables: `variables.yml`**
```yaml
ROOT_PATH: "/home/user/projects"
AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
SLACK_CHANNEL: "#alerts"
```

## The Complete Picture

1. **Define your tools** in `template.json` (MCP servers)
2. **Create agents** in `.prompt` files (combine tools + AI prompt)  
3. **Set environment variables** in `variables.yml`
4. **Deploy as bundle** - everything travels together

Your agents can combine tools from multiple MCP servers:
- `__read_file` + `__list_directory` (from filesystem server)
- `__slack_post_message` (from Slack server)  
- `__get_cost_and_usage` (from AWS server)

**Everything you need is in the dotprompt** - portable, versionable, deployable.

## Advanced Features

### **MCP Server Integration**

Station can serve as an MCP server for other AI applications:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

This provides tools like `call_agent`, `create_agent`, `list_agents` to any MCP-compatible application.

### **Interactive Development Playground**

**NEW**: Station includes a powerful interactive development environment powered by Firebase Genkit:

```bash
genkit start -- stn develop --env dev
```

This launches a complete browser-based development playground where you can:
- **Test agents interactively** with custom task inputs
- **Debug tool calling** with real-time execution traces  
- **Access all MCP tools** from your environment
- **Iterate on prompts** with live reloading
- **Analyze execution flows** with detailed logging

Perfect for developing and testing agents before deployment.

## CI/CD Integration

Station provides **three production-ready patterns** for integrating AI agents into your CI/CD pipelines:

### üê≥ **Agent-as-a-Service (Docker)**
Deploy agents in containerized environments for maximum isolation and scalability.

**Build Production-Ready Containers:**
```bash
# Build containerized environment with agents pre-configured
stn build env security-bundle \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5-mini \
  --cloudshipai-registration-key $CLOUDSHIP_KEY

# Container includes:
# ‚úÖ Station binary + all dependencies (Node.js, npx)
# ‚úÖ Agents imported and ready to execute
# ‚úÖ Runtime variable resolution (PROJECT_ROOT, etc.)
# ‚úÖ All MCP tools connected and validated
```

**Use in CI/CD Pipelines:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example with Ship Security Tools
- name: Run Security Analysis
  run: |
    docker run --rm \
      -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/workspace \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -e PROJECT_ROOT=/workspace \
      -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} \
      your-registry/station-security:latest \
      stn agent run "Security Scanner" "Analyze project for vulnerabilities"

# Docker socket access required for Ship security tools (trivy, grype, etc.)
```

### üîß **Direct Station Execution**
Execute agents directly in CI runners with full MCP tool access.

```bash
# Install Station in CI
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash

# Configure and run agents
stn init --provider openai --model gpt-4o
stn agent import production
stn agent run sbom-security-agent "Generate SBOM and vulnerability analysis"
```

### ‚ö° **Dagger Integration**
Programmatic orchestration with type-safe Go modules for complex CI workflows.

```go
// Dagger module for Station CI
func (m *StationCI) SecurityScan(
    ctx context.Context,
    stationSource *dagger.Directory,
    source *dagger.Directory,
    openaiKey *dagger.Secret,
) *dagger.Container {
    return m.BuildStationBase(ctx, stationSource).
        WithDirectory("/workspace", source).
        WithSecretVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY", openaiKey).
        WithExec([]string{"stn", "agent", "run", "security-scanner"})
}
```
