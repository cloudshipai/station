# Station - Secure AI Agent Runtime

**Deploy AI agents inside your infrastructure without exposing credentials to external services.**

Station is a self-hosted runtime that lets you create intelligent AI agents with natural language, then run them on your schedule with your permissions - all without your secrets ever leaving your network.

## Core Value Propositions

### üîí **Keep Your Secrets Secret**
**Your credentials never leave your infrastructure.** Station runs inside your network and only sends task descriptions to AI providers, never API keys, database passwords, or sensitive data.

**How Station Helps:** Deploy Station within your VPC/network perimeter. Configure it once with your tools and credentials, then create unlimited agents that inherit your permissions without exposing them externally.

**Example:**
```bash
# Your AWS keys stay local, only task descriptions go to AI provider
./stn load examples/mcps/aws-cli.json  # AWS keys stored locally
./stn agent create "AWS Monitor" "Check EC2 instances and alert on issues"
./stn agent run 1 "List running instances and their health status"
# ‚Üí Agent uses local AWS credentials, AI provider never sees them
```

### üß† **Create Agents with Natural Language**
**Describe what you want, get a working agent in seconds.** Station uses AI to analyze your requirements and automatically selects the optimal tools and configuration.

**How Station Helps:** Station's self-bootstrapping intelligence analyzes your environment, understands available tools, and creates agents with perfect tool assignments based on simple descriptions.

**Example:**
```bash
# Describe intent in plain English, get intelligent agent
./stn agent create \
  --name "Database Health Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor PostgreSQL performance and alert on issues" \
  --domain "database-administration"

# Station automatically assigns: postgresql tools, monitoring tools, alerting tools
# No manual configuration needed - AI figures out what you need
```

### ‚ö° **One Binary, Zero Dependencies**
**40MB binary with everything included.** No Docker, no Kubernetes required, no complex installation - just download and run anywhere.

**How Station Helps:** Single statically-linked binary includes web UI, SSH terminal, API server, database, and all runtime components. Works on any Linux, macOS, or Windows machine.

**Example:**
```bash
# Production deployment in 30 seconds
curl -sSL https://getstation.ai/install | bash
./stn init
./stn server &
# ‚Üí Full AI agent platform running
```

### üèóÔ∏è **GitOps-Ready Configuration**
**All configuration stored as files for version control and automation.** Treat your AI agents like infrastructure code with full audit trails and rollback capability.

**How Station Helps:** File-based configuration system with template variables makes it easy to version control your agent configurations and deploy them across environments using standard DevOps practices.

**Example:**
```bash
# Export agent configuration as code
./stn agent export 1 production
# Creates: ~/.config/station/environments/production/agents/db-monitor.json

# Version control your agents
git add ~/.config/station/environments/
git commit -m "Add database monitoring agent"

# Deploy to other environments
./stn agent import staging  # GitOps deployment
```

### üéØ **Intelligent Multi-Step Execution**
**Agents automatically plan and execute complex tasks across multiple tools.** No need to manually chain commands or write scripts - just describe the outcome you want.

**How Station Helps:** Station uses Google's Genkit framework with dynamic iteration limits (1-25 steps) that automatically adjust based on task complexity, ensuring efficient execution without manual tuning.

**Example:**
```bash
./stn agent run 1 "Check database performance, identify slow queries, create Jira ticket if issues found, and notify team in Slack"

# Station automatically:
# Step 1: Connects to PostgreSQL and runs performance queries
# Step 2: Analyzes query execution times and identifies bottlenecks  
# Step 3: Creates detailed Jira ticket with findings
# Step 4: Posts summary to team Slack channel
# ‚Üí Complex workflow executed intelligently without manual orchestration
```

### üè¢ **Enterprise-Ready Security**
**SOC 2/HIPAA/ISO 27001 compatible with comprehensive audit trails.** Built for enterprises that need AI automation without compromising security posture.

**How Station Helps:** Role-based access control, encryption at rest, comprehensive audit logging, and zero-trust architecture mean you can deploy confidently in regulated environments.

**Example:**
```bash
# Enterprise deployment with full security
./stn user create alice --role admin
./stn user create bob --role developer  
./stn settings set audit_logging true
./stn webhook create --url "https://siem.company.com/station-events"

# All actions logged for compliance:
# 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z alice created agent "prod-monitor" in production
# 2024-01-15T10:31:12Z bob executed agent 1: "Check system health"
```

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install Station
```bash
# Option 1: Build from source (current)
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/station
cd station && go build -o stn ./cmd/main

# Option 2: Binary install (coming soon)  
curl -sSL https://getstation.ai/install | bash
```

### 2. Initialize and Load Tools
```bash
# Initialize with secure defaults
./stn init

# Load filesystem tools (22+ templates available)
./stn load examples/mcps/filesystem.json

# View all available templates
ls examples/mcps/  # AWS, GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.
```

### 3. Create and Run Agent
```bash
# Create intelligent agent
./stn agent create \
  --name "System Explorer" \
  --description "Analyze file systems and provide insights" \
  --domain "system-administration"

# Run agent with natural language task
./stn agent run 1 "Analyze the project directory structure and identify any issues"

# View results
./stn runs list
```

## Rich Template Library

Station includes **22+ production-ready MCP server templates** covering common enterprise use cases:

| Category | Templates | Description |

| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Firebase | Connect to any database system |
| **Cloud** | AWS CLI, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloudflare | Manage cloud infrastructure |  
| **DevOps** | GitHub, Git, Docker, SSH, Prometheus | Development and operations |
| **AI/LLM** | OpenAI, Anthropic Claude | AI model integrations |

```bash
# Browse all templates
cat examples/mcps/README.md

# Load multiple templates for complex workflows
./stn load examples/mcps/github.json
./stn load examples/mcps/aws-cli.json  
./stn load examples/mcps/slack.json

# Create agent that uses multiple services
./stn agent create "DevOps Assistant" "Manage GitHub repos, deploy to AWS, notify in Slack"
```

## Architecture

Station's **self-bootstrapping architecture** means it manages itself through its own MCP interface:

```
Your AI Provider ‚Üí Station Runtime ‚Üí Your Infrastructure Tools
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                     ‚Üì
  Task Only      Self-Bootstrapping      Full Permissions
(No Secrets)    Intelligence (Genkit)   (Local Access)
```

**Key Innovation:** Station provides its own MCP server with 13 management tools, allowing it to intelligently create and manage agents using AI analysis of your requirements.
