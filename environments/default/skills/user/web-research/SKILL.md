# Web Research Skill

## When to Use
- User asks you to research a topic
- You need to gather information from multiple sources
- Task requires fact-checking or verification

## Workflow

### 1. Define Scope
Before searching, clarify:
- What specific questions need answering?
- What depth of coverage is needed?
- Are there preferred or authoritative sources?

### 2. Search Strategy
Execute searches in this order:
1. Broad overview search
2. Specific fact-finding searches
3. Alternative viewpoint searches

### 3. Source Evaluation
For each source, assess:
- Authority (who wrote it?)
- Currency (when published?)
- Relevance (does it answer the question?)

### 4. Synthesis
Combine findings into a coherent summary with citations.

## Examples
