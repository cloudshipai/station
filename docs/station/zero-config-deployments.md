# Zero-Config Deployments

Deploy Station agents to production without manual configuration.

## What is Zero-Config Deployment?

Zero-config deployments automatically discover and configure:
- Cloud credentials (AWS IAM roles, service accounts)
- Service discovery (databases, APIs, endpoints)
- MCP tool connections with production settings
- Template variables from environment

No manual configuration files neededâ€”Station detects and configures everything automatically.
