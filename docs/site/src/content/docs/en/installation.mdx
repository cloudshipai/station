# Installation

Station provides multiple installation methods to fit your environment and preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Station, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Purpose | Required |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **AI Provider** | One of: Claude Max/Pro subscription, OpenAI API key, or Gemini API key | ✅ Yes |
| **Docker** | For Jaeger tracing (`stn jaeger up`) and optional containerized mode | Recommended |

:::tip[Claude Max/Pro Recommended]
Claude Max/Pro subscribers get the best experience - authenticate with `stn auth anthropic login` after install. No API key management needed.
:::

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Station is using our installation script:

### Linux / macOS
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Detect your platform automatically
- Download the appropriate binary
- Install to your system PATH
- Verify the installation

## Manual Installation

### Download from GitHub Releases

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/releases):

```bash
# Linux x64
curl -Lo stn https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/releases/latest/download/stn-linux-amd64
chmod +x stn && sudo mv stn /usr/local/bin/

# Linux ARM64
curl -Lo stn https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/releases/latest/download/stn-linux-arm64
chmod +x stn && sudo mv stn /usr/local/bin/

# macOS Intel
curl -Lo stn https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/releases/latest/download/stn-darwin-amd64
chmod +x stn && sudo mv stn /usr/local/bin/

# macOS Apple Silicon
curl -Lo stn https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/releases/latest/download/stn-darwin-arm64
chmod +x stn && sudo mv stn /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from Source

Requirements:
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station
cd station
make local-install
```

This will build Station and install it to `~/.local/bin/stn`.

## Docker Installation

Run Station in a container with all dependencies pre-configured:

```bash
# Start Station with Docker
stn up

# View status
stn status

# View logs
stn logs

# Stop Station
stn down
```

This starts Station with:
- **Port 8585**: Web UI and REST API
- **Port 8586**: MCP Server
- **Port 8587**: SSH Terminal
- **Port 16686**: Jaeger UI (tracing)

See [Docker Deployment](/station/en/deployment/docker) for advanced configuration.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify Station is working:

```bash
stn version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Station v0.1.0
Build: abc1234
Platform: linux/amd64
```

## Next Steps

Now that Station is installed:

1. **[Initialize Station](/station/en/quickstart#1-initialize-station)** - Set up your first environment
2. **[Quick Start Guide](/station/en/quickstart)** - Create and run your first agent
3. **[Architecture Overview](/station/en/architecture)** - Understand how Station works

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you get permission denied errors:

```bash
# Make sure the binary is executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stn

# Or install to a user directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv stn ~/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Command Not Found

If `stn` command is not found:

1. Check if the binary is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   which stn
   ```

2. Add the installation directory to your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

See [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) for the list of supported architectures.

If your platform isn't listed, try [building from source](#build-from-source) or [open an issue](https://github.com/cloudshipai/station/issues).
