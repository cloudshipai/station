# Installation

Station provides multiple installation methods to fit your environment and preferences.

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Station is using our installation script:

### Linux / macOS
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Detect your platform automatically
- Download the appropriate binary
- Install to your system PATH
- Verify the installation

## Manual Installation

### Build from Source

Requirements:
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station
cd station
make local-install
```

This will build Station and install it to `~/.local/bin/stn`.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify Station is working:

```bash
stn version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Station v0.1.0
Build: abc1234
Platform: linux/amd64
```

## Next Steps

Now that Station is installed:

1. **[Initialize Station](/station/en/quickstart#1-initialize-station)** - Set up your first environment
2. **[Quick Start Guide](/station/en/quickstart)** - Create and run your first agent
3. **[Architecture Overview](/station/en/architecture)** - Understand how Station works

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you get permission denied errors:

```bash
# Make sure the binary is executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stn

# Or install to a user directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv stn ~/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Command Not Found

If `stn` command is not found:

1. Check if the binary is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   which stn
   ```

2. Add the installation directory to your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
   ```
