# Quick Start

Get Station running with production-ready security agents in 3 simple steps.

## ðŸš€ 3-Step Setup

### 1. Install Station

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Initialize and Install Security Bundle

```bash
# Initialize Station
stn init

# Install DevOps Security Bundle with Checkov and TFLint agents
curl -X POST http://localhost:8585/bundles/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bundle_location": "https://github.com/cloudshipai/registry/releases/latest/download/devops-security-bundle.tar.gz",
    "environment_name": "security",
    "source": "remote"
  }'
```

### 3. Sync and Connect

```bash
# Sync MCP tools and agents
stn sync

# Add Station to Claude Desktop
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}' > ~/.claude_desktop_config.json
```

## âœ… You're Ready!

**Open the Station UI:** [http://localhost:8585](http://localhost:8585)

You'll see your installed security bundle with agents and MCP tools ready to use:

**Test your security agents:**
```bash
stn agent run "Security Scanner" "Scan the current directory for security vulnerabilities"
```

**Connect to Claude Code** - Station MCP tools are now available for creating agents, running security scans, and managing environments directly from Claude conversations.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Get

- **2 Production-Ready Agents**: Security Scanner + Terraform Auditor
- **16 Security Tools**: Checkov, TFLint, and more via Ship CLI
- **Web Interface**: Manage agents, view runs, install bundles
- **Claude Code Integration**: Create and run agents through natural conversation
- **CI/CD Ready**: Use in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any container environment

## Access Methods

Station provides multiple ways to interact with your agents:

### Command Line

```bash
# Direct agent execution
stn agent run 1 "task description"

# List agents
stn agent list

# Check system status
stn status
```

### SSH/TUI Access

```bash
# Access admin interface via SSH
ssh admin@localhost -p 2222
```

Interactive terminal interface for managing agents and viewing logs.

### REST API

```bash
# Queue agent execution

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Check system status"}'
```

### WebSocket

Real-time updates and streaming responses for agent execution and system events.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create Agent** - `stn agent create` to define your agent
2. **Test Locally** - `stn agent run` to test functionality
3. **Export Template** - `stn agent export` to create reusable templates
4. **Version Control** - `git add & commit` for your agent configurations
5. **Deploy** - Copy template configs and sync in production environment
6. **Monitor** - Use SSH/API access to monitor execution
