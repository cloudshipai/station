# Other MCP Clients

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on comprehensive documentation for connecting Station to various MCP clients beyond Claude Desktop.

## What This Will Cover

- **Cursor Integration** - Setting up Station with Cursor editor
- **VS Code Extensions** - MCP extensions that work with Station
- **Custom MCP Clients** - Building your own MCP clients
- **API Integration** - Using Station's MCP API directly
- **Third-party Tools** - Other tools that support MCP protocol

## Quick Reference

Station works with any MCP-compatible client:

**stdio Mode (recommended for local clients):**
```json
{
  "command": "stn",
  "args": ["stdio"]
}
```

**HTTP Mode (for remote clients):**
```bash
# Start Station MCP server
stn serve --mcp-port 3000

# Connect via HTTP
# URL: http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

## Supported Clients

- **Claude Desktop** - Primary integration (see dedicated guide)
- **Claude Code** - Same configuration as Claude Desktop
- **Cursor** - MCP support (configuration needed)
- **Custom Clients** - Any tool implementing MCP protocol
