# Environment Isolation

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on comprehensive documentation for managing agents across multiple environments.

## What This Will Cover

- **Environment Setup** - Creating and configuring dev, staging, and production environments
- **Agent Isolation** - How agents are isolated between environments
- **Variable Management** - Environment-specific configuration variables
- **Tool Access Control** - Different tool permissions per environment
- **Cross-Environment Workflows** - Promoting agents between environments

## Quick Reference

Each environment has its own configuration directory:

```
~/.config/station/environments/
â”œâ”€â”€ development/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.json (MCP configs)
â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
â””â”€â”€ production/
```

## Key Concepts

- **Environment Isolation**: Agents belong to specific environments
- **Independent Tool Pools**: Each environment has its own MCP tool configuration
- **Variable Resolution**: Same MCP templates, different variable values per environment

## Next Steps

- **[Agent Management Overview](/station/en/agents/overview)** - See environment isolation in action
- **[MCP Integration Overview](/station/en/mcp/overview)** - Understanding template variable resolution
