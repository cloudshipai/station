# Agent Configuration

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on detailed documentation for advanced agent configuration options.

## What This Will Cover

## Quick Reference

Agent configurations are stored as `.prompt` files in your Station environment:

```
~/.config/station/environments/default/agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-agent.prompt
â”œâ”€â”€ another-agent.prompt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
