# Intelligent Agents

Station's intelligent agents are the core of the system - deployable sub-agents designed to handle specific operational tasks with AI-powered decision making.

## What are Intelligent Agents?

Intelligent agents in Station are:
- **AI-powered** - Use large language models for reasoning and decision making
- **Tool-enabled** - Access to 20+ MCP tools for infrastructure operations
- **Deployable** - Can be packaged, versioned, and deployed like code
- **Environment-aware** - Understand dev/staging/prod contexts and constraints

## Agent Lifecycle

### Creation
```bash
stn agent create \
  --name "Database Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor database health and performance"
```

### Configuration
Agents are configured through `.prompt` files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: "Database Monitor"
description: "Monitor database health and alert on issues"
max_steps: 10
tools_required: ["postgres", "slack"]
environment: "production"
---

You are a database monitoring specialist. Your job is to:
1. Check database connection pools
2. Monitor query performance
3. Alert if any metrics exceed thresholds
4. Generate detailed reports for the ops team
```

### Execution
```bash
# Direct execution
stn agent run 1 "Check database health and report any issues"

# Scheduled execution
stn agent schedule 1 "0 */6 * * *"  # Every 6 hours
```

## Agent Capabilities

### Multi-Step Reasoning
Agents can break down complex tasks into multiple steps:
1. **Assessment** - Analyze the current situation
2. **Planning** - Determine the best course of action  
3. **Execution** - Perform necessary operations
4. **Validation** - Verify results and success
5. **Reporting** - Communicate outcomes

### Tool Integration
Agents have access to production-grade tools:
- **Infrastructure** - AWS CLI, Kubernetes, Docker, SSH
- **Databases** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Monitoring** - Prometheus, Grafana, system metrics
- **Communication** - Slack, email, PagerDuty webhooks

### Context Awareness
Agents understand their operational context:
- Current environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Available tools and permissions
- Previous execution history
- System state and metrics

## Agent Types

### Monitoring Agents
```bash
stn agent create --name "System Monitor" \
  --description "Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage across servers"
```
- Continuous system health monitoring
- Threshold-based alerting
- Performance trend analysis
- Capacity planning recommendations

### Deployment Agents  
```bash
stn agent create --name "Deploy Pipeline" \
  --description "Automated deployment with rollback capability"
```
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Health check validation
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Deployment approval workflows

### Security Agents
```bash
stn agent create --name "Security Scanner" \
  --description "Vulnerability scanning and compliance checks"
```
- Automated security scanning
- Compliance verification
- Access audit trails
- Incident response automation

## Agent Communication

### Inter-Agent Coordination
Agents can communicate and coordinate:
```bash
# Agent 1 triggers Agent 2
stn agent run 1 "Check system health, if critical issues found, trigger deployment rollback agent"
```

### Webhook Integration
Agents can send notifications to external systems:
- Slack channels for alerts
- PagerDuty for incidents
- Email for reports
- Custom webhooks for integrations

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has one clear purpose
- **Idempotent Operations** - Safe to run multiple times
- **Proper Error Handling** - Graceful failure and recovery
- **Clear Communication** - Detailed logging and reporting

### Security Considerations
- **Least Privilege** - Agents only have necessary permissions
- **Environment Isolation** - Production agents isolated from dev/staging
- **Audit Trails** - All agent actions are logged and traceable
- **Secret Management** - Sensitive data encrypted and rotated

### Operational Excellence
- **Monitoring** - Agent performance and health metrics
- **Testing** - Agents tested in lower environments first
- **Documentation** - Clear descriptions and usage examples
- **Version Control** - Agent configurations tracked in git
