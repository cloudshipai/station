# Bundle Registry

## üöß Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on a comprehensive bundle registry for discovering Station templates.

## What This Will Cover

- **Browse Available Bundles** - Discover pre-built Station bundles
- **Bundle Categories** - Bundles organized by use case and domain
- **Installation Instructions** - How to install and use registry bundles
- **Community Contributions** - Contributing bundles to the registry
- **Bundle Ratings & Reviews** - Community feedback on bundles

## Quick Reference

For now, you can browse the bundle registry at:

üåê **[Browse Bundle Registry](https://cloudshipai.github.io/registry)**

Install bundles directly:

```bash
# Install a bundle from the registry
stn template install https://cloudshipai.github.io/registry/bundles/filesystem-bundle.tar.gz

# Sync to load the bundle
stn sync default
```

## Next Steps

- **[Creating Bundles](/station/en/bundles/creating)** - Create your own bundles
- **[Publishing Bundles](/station/en/bundles/publishing)** - Share bundles with the community
