# Production Setup

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on comprehensive documentation for deploying Station in production environments.

## What This Will Cover

- **Production Architecture** - Recommended production deployment patterns
- **Server Configuration** - Configuring Station for production workloads
- **Database Setup** - Production database configuration and backups
- **Load Balancing** - Scaling Station across multiple instances
- **Container Deployment** - Docker and Kubernetes deployment guides

## Quick Reference

Basic production server setup:

```bash
# Start Station server with production settings
stn serve --api-port 8585 --mcp-port 8586 --ssh-port 2222

# Run in background with systemd (example)
sudo systemctl enable station
sudo systemctl start station
```
