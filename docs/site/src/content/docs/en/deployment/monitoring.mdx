# Monitoring & Observability

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on comprehensive documentation for monitoring Station deployments and agent performance.

## What This Will Cover

- **Metrics Collection** - Key metrics to monitor in Station
- **Logging Strategy** - Structured logging and log aggregation
- **Performance Monitoring** - Tracking agent execution and system performance
- **Alerting & Notifications** - Setting up alerts for critical issues
- **Dashboards & Visualization** - Building monitoring dashboards

## Quick Reference

Basic monitoring commands:

```bash
# View recent agent runs
stn runs list --limit 50

# Check system status
stn status

# View audit logs
stn logs audit

# Monitor agent execution
stn agent run "Agent Name" "Task" --tail
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Agent Execution Success Rate** - Percentage of successful agent runs
- **Response Times** - How long agents take to complete tasks
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- **Error Rates** - Frequency and types of agent failures
- **MCP Tool Performance** - Tool response times and availability

## Next Steps

- **[Production Setup](/station/en/deployment/production)** - Set up production monitoring
- **[Security Configuration](/station/en/deployment/security)** - Monitor security events
