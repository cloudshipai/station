# Security Configuration

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

This page is under construction. We're working on comprehensive documentation for securing Station deployments and agent operations.

## What This Will Cover

- **Authentication & Authorization** - User access control and permissions
- **Network Security** - TLS, firewall, and network isolation
- **Secret Management** - Secure handling of credentials and API keys
- **Agent Security** - Controlling agent access to sensitive resources
- **Audit & Compliance** - Logging and monitoring for security compliance

## Quick Reference

Security considerations for Station:

```bash
# Run with authentication enabled
stn serve --auth-required

# Check audit logs
stn logs audit --filter security

# Manage access keys
stn key generate
stn key list
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Give agents minimal necessary permissions
- **Environment Isolation** - Separate dev/staging/production access
- **Credential Rotation** - Regular rotation of API keys and secrets
- **Network Segmentation** - Isolate Station from sensitive networks
- **Regular Updates** - Keep Station and dependencies updated

## Next Steps

- **[Production Setup](/station/en/deployment/production)** - General production deployment
- **[Monitoring & Observability](/station/en/deployment/monitoring)** - Monitor security events
