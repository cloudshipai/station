- **Encrypted Secrets** - AES encryption for credentials and sensitive configuration
- **Environment Isolation** - Separate execution contexts for dev/staging/prod
- **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of agent deployments and executions

### âš¡ Lightweight & Integrated
- **Single 45MB Binary** - No complex infrastructure or dependencies
- **SQLite Database** - Zero-setup local development, PostgreSQL for production
- **GitOps Ready** - Version-controlled agent configurations like infrastructure code
- **Existing Toolchain** - Uses your team's approved MCP tools and integrations
