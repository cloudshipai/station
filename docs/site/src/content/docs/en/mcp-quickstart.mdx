# MCP Quick Start

Get Station agents running in Claude Desktop (or Claude Code) in under 5 minutes. This is the fastest way to start using Station's deployable sub-agents.

## The 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install Station Binary

```bash
# Quick install (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash

# Verify installation
stn --version
```

### 2. Initialize Station

```bash
stn init
```

This creates your Station workspace and initializes the local database.

### 3. Install a Ready-to-Use Bundle

Instead of creating agents from scratch, let's install a pre-built bundle:

```bash
# Install filesystem operations bundle
stn template install https://github.com/cloudshipai/registry/raw/main/bundles/filesystem-bundle/filesystem-bundle.tar.gz

# Or install infrastructure monitoring bundle (if available)
stn template install https://github.com/cloudshipai/registry/raw/main/bundles/infrastructure-bundle/infrastructure-bundle.tar.gz
```

### 4. Sync Configuration

```bash
stn sync production
```

This ensures all tools and agents are properly configured and ready.

### 5. Add Station to Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file:

**Location of config file:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Add this configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should now see Station tools available.

## Start Using Station Agents

Once connected, you can immediately start using Station agents through Claude Desktop:

### List Available Agents
```
List my Station agents
```

### Create a New Agent
```
Create a new Station agent for monitoring disk usage with these tools: file operations
```

### Run an Existing Agent
```
Run Station agent filesystem-scanner with the task: check current directory structure and report any large files over 100MB
```

### Manage Tools and Bundles
```
Show me what MCP tools are available in my Station setup
```

## What Just Happened?

In these 5 steps, you've:

1. **Installed** a lightweight 45MB Station runtime
2. **Loaded** pre-built agents with production-ready tools  
3. **Connected** Station to Claude Desktop via MCP protocol
4. **Gained access** to deployable sub-agents that can handle infrastructure, monitoring, deployment, and security tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Station not showing up in Claude Desktop?
1. Verify `stn stdio` works: `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | stn stdio`
2. Check Claude Desktop config file syntax with a JSON validator
3. Make sure Claude Desktop was fully restarted after config changes

### No agents available?
1. Run `stn agent list` to verify agents are created
2. Run `stn sync production` to ensure configurations are up-to-date
3. Install a bundle if you haven't: `stn template install <bundle-url>`

### Permission issues?
1. Ensure Station binary has execute permissions: `chmod +x $(which stn)`
2. Check that Station can write to its workspace directory

**You're now ready to deploy intelligent sub-agents through Claude Desktop!**

The agents you create can handle sensitive internal tasks like database monitoring, deployment automation, and security scanning - all while maintaining secure access controls and audit trails.
