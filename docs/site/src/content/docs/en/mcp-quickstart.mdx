# MCP Quick Start

Get Station agents running in Claude Desktop (or Claude Code) in under 5 minutes. This is the fastest way to start using Station's deployable sub-agents.

## The 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install Station Binary

```bash
# Quick install (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudshipai/station/main/install.sh | bash

# Verify installation
stn --version
```

### 2. Initialize Station

```bash
stn init
```

This creates your Station workspace and initializes the local database.

### 3. Create and Load an MCP Configuration

Create a filesystem MCP config directly in your Station environment:

**Copy this config to `~/.config/station/environments/default/template.json`:**
```json
{
  "description": "Essential filesystem operations with MCP server integration",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", 
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest",
        "{{ .ALLOWED_PATH }}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "name": "filesystem-updated"
}
```

**Create variables file:**
```bash
# Create variables.yml with the template variable
echo "ALLOWED_PATH: /home/user/projects" > ~/.config/station/environments/default/variables.yml
```

**Sync to discover tools:**
```bash
stn sync
```

**Output:**
```
╭─────────────────────────────╮

   🔧 Tool 4: __write_file
   🔧 Tool 5: __edit_file
   [... 9 more tools discovered]

✅ Sync completed successfully!
```

### 4. Add Station to Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file:

**Location of config file:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Add this configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "station": {
      "command": "stn",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should now see Station tools available.

## Start Using Station Agents

Once connected, you can immediately start using Station agents through Claude Desktop:

### Create Your First Agent

**You:** `"Create a code review agent that can analyze files and provide feedback"`

**Claude Response:**
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "description": "A basic agent that reviews code files and provides feedback",
    "environment_id": 1,
    "id": 53,
    "name": "Simple Code Reviewer"
  },
  "message": "Agent 'Simple Code Reviewer' created successfully",
  "tool_assignment": {
    "assigned_count": 2,
    "assigned_tools": ["__read_text_file", "__list_directory"],
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

*Claude automatically selected the right tools from your MCP servers!*

### Run Your Agent

**You:** `"Run my code review agent to analyze the current project structure"`

**Agent Response:**
```
I inspected the repository root and analyzed the project structure...

What I see:
- Project identity: This is a Go-based runtime/CLI project called 'Station'  
- Language/build: go.mod, go.sum — Go project with cmd/, internal/, pkg/ layout
- Runtime assets: stn — built CLI binary, station.db — SQLite database
- Deployment: docker/, Dockerfile, .goreleaser.yml — containerized deployment

Brief summary: This is a Go-based, self-hosted runtime that provides a 
lightweight platform for deploying and running 'sub-agents'...
```

*Full comprehensive analysis with complete tool usage - nothing truncated.*

### List Your Agents

**You:** `"List all my Station agents"`

**Response:** Shows all your created agents with IDs, names, descriptions, and tool assignments.

## What Just Happened?

In these 5 steps, you've:

1. **Installed** a lightweight Station runtime and initialized your workspace
2. **Loaded** MCP tools (filesystem operations) that agents can use
3. **Connected** Station to Claude Desktop via MCP protocol
4. **Created** your first deployable sub-agent through natural conversation
5. **Executed** the agent and saw complete, untruncated responses

Your agents can now combine tools from multiple MCP servers and be deployed across environments as `.prompt` files!

## Troubleshooting

### Station not showing up in Claude Desktop?
1. Verify `stn stdio` works: `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | stn stdio`
2. Check Claude Desktop config file syntax with a JSON validator
3. Make sure Claude Desktop was fully restarted after config changes

### No MCP tools available for agent creation?
1. Copy a template config to your environment directory: `~/.config/station/environments/default/template.json`
2. Add any required variables to `variables.yml` 
3. Sync the configuration: `stn sync`
4. Restart Claude Desktop after syncing new tools

### Agent creation failing?
1. Make sure you have MCP tools loaded (agents need tools to be useful)
2. Verify Station initialization completed: `stn status`
3. Check if the environment exists: `stn mcp environments list`

**You're now ready to deploy intelligent sub-agents through Claude Desktop!**

The agents you create can handle sensitive internal tasks like database monitoring, deployment automation, and security scanning - all while maintaining secure access controls and audit trails.
