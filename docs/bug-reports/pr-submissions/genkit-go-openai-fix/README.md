# Genkit Go OpenAI Plugin - Tool Call ID Bug Fix

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive documentation, test cases, and potential fixes for a critical bug in Firebase Genkit's Go OpenAI plugin that causes tool execution failures when tool call IDs exceed OpenAI's 40-character limit.

## Issue Summary

**Bug**: OpenAI tool execution fails with "Invalid 'tool_call_id': string too long. Expected a string with maximum length 40"

**Root Cause**: `/home/epuerta/projects/hack/genkit/go/plugins/compat_oai/generate.go:402` uses tool execution results as tool_call_id instead of the short reference ID.

**Impact**: This bug affects the entire Genkit Go OpenAI ecosystem, making multi-turn tool execution unreliable in production environments.
