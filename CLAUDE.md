# Claude Agent Context for Station Development

## Project Overview
Station is a secure, self-hosted platform for creating intelligent multi-environment MCP agents that integrate with Claude. The system allows users to build AI agents that understand development workflows, manage sensitive tools across environments, and run automated background tasks.

## Current System State

### âœ… Completed Major Architecture Overhaul
- **Modular Handler Architecture**: âœ… Complete - Split 5 large files (5,777 lines) into 43 focused modules
  - All handler modules now under 500 lines for maximum maintainability
  - Clean separation of concerns with `agent/`, `file_config/`, `load/`, `mcp/`, `webhooks/` modules
  - Shared utilities in `common/` module for DRY code organization

- **File-Based Configuration System**: âœ… Fully Migrated from database-based to file-based MCP configs
  - GitOps-ready configuration management with Go template support
  - Template variable resolution for environment-specific deployments
  - Removed old `mcp_configs`, `template_variables`, and related database tables
  - Updated all services, handlers, and TUI components to use file-based system

- **CLI Agent Execution**: âœ… Implemented with clean server/fallback architecture
  - **Server Mode**: Uses `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/queue` with ExecutionQueueService for full execution
  - **Fallback Mode**: Provides simplified execution when server not available
  - **Clean DRY**: Reuses existing execution architecture, no code duplication
  - **Webhook Support**: Full webhook notifications work in server mode
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Clear messaging about mode limitations

- **Template Variable Processing**: âœ… Fixed critical hanging agent issue
  - **Root Cause**: Regex-based variable detection failed with spaces in `{{ .ROOT_PATH }}`
  - **Solution**: Eliminated regex detection, always load `variables.yml` and use Go template engine
  - **Key Fix**: `template_variable_service.go:48-94` - proper template processing without fragile regex
  - **MCP Template Sync**: Fixed `declarative_sync.go` to process individual JSON templates during `stn sync`

- **Detailed Agent Run Capture**: âœ… Restored full execution metadata tracking
  - **Issue**: CLI switched from `AgentExecutionEngine` to simplified `dotprompt.GenKitExecutor`
  - **Lost Data**: Tool calls, execution steps, token usage, detailed timing not captured
  - **Solution**: CLI now uses full `AgentExecutionEngine` with proper run creation/completion
  - **Captured Data**: Every tool call with parameters, execution steps, token usage, duration
  - **Database**: All runs saved with complete metadata via `UpdateCompletionWithMetadata`
  - **Commands**: `stn runs list` and `stn runs inspect <id> -v` show full execution details

- **Interactive Sync Flow**: âœ… Complete UI-based variable prompting system
  - **Features**: Real-time sync progress, variable forms, Monaco Editor integration
  - **Multi-Variable Detection**: Handles all missing variables in single interaction
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful 404 handling, automatic UI refresh after completion
  - **UI Integration**: SyncModal with Tokyo Night theme, uncontrolled inputs
  - **Backend**: Custom VariableResolver, enhanced DeclarativeSync service
  - **User Experience**: Seamless variable prompting without CLI intervention

- **MCP Agent Execution Fix**: âœ… Fixed critical runID=0 bug in v0.9.1
  - **Root Cause**: ExecutionQueue passed runID=0 to AgentService, breaking debug logging
  - **Impact**: MCP agents ran silently for 72+ seconds with no logs or metadata
  - **Solution**: Added ExecuteAgentWithRunID() method to pass real run ID through execution chain
  - **Result**: MCP agents now have full logging, live execution tracking, and proper metadata
  - **Location**: `agent_service_impl.go:105-177`, `agent_service_interface.go:16-17`, `execution_queue.go:316-319`

- **Complete Webhook Removal**: âœ… Streamlined platform focus (Dec 2024)
  - **Scope**: Removed 3,340+ lines across 44 files including CLI handlers, API endpoints, services, and database layer
  - **Components Removed**: Webhook delivery system, HTTP retry logic, notification infrastructure, management UI
  - **Preserved**: Settings table and CLI commands (list/get/set) for general system configuration
  - **Impact**: Platform now focused exclusively on core agent execution and MCP integration capabilities
  - **Migration**: Created `015_add_settings_only.sql` preserving settings functionality without webhook dependencies
  - **Commit**: `e3ba63d8` - Complete cleanup positioning Station as streamlined AI agent orchestration platform

### Known Issues
- **SSH/MCP Shutdown Performance**: Graceful shutdown takes ~1m25s (should be <10s)
  - Likely causes: hanging MCP connections, database locks, resource cleanup delays
  - Needs investigation of timeout settings and connection pooling

### Active Agents
- **Home Directory Scanner** (ID: 2): Scheduled daily at midnight to scan home directory structure
  - Tools: list_directory, directory_tree, read_text_file, get_file_info, search_files
  - Max steps: 5

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **MCP Server**: Handles tool discovery and agent communication
- **Agent Management**: Scheduling, execution, and monitoring system  
- **Environment Management**: Multi-environment tool isolation (dev/staging/prod)
- **File Configuration System**: GitOps-ready config management with template variables
- **Settings Management**: System configuration via CLI commands (list/get/set operations)
- **Security Layer**: Audit logging, access controls, secure file-based configuration

### Key Directories
- `/station/` - Main project directory
- Config files likely in standard locations (`.config/`, `~/.station/`, etc.)
- Database: SQLite-based configuration storage

## Development Best Practices

### File Management & Clean Development
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- **NEVER** create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Use `TodoWrite` tool for task tracking and planning
- Maintain concise responses (â‰¤4 lines unless detail requested)

### Keep Root Directory Clean
- **NEVER** create temporary files in project root
- Use `dev-workspace/` for temporary development artifacts:
  - `dev-workspace/test-configs/` - Temporary MCP configs and test files
  - `dev-workspace/test-scripts/` - Development and testing scripts
  - `dev-workspace/test-artifacts/` - Built binaries, databases, generated files
  - `dev-workspace/ssh-keys/` - SSH host keys for development
- **Automated cleanup**: Root-level test files are gitignored and cleaned automatically
- **Before committing**: Ensure no temporary files pollute the root directory

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code and primary development branch
- **feature/***: Feature branches for larger features (PRs to main when ready)
- **fix/***: Bug fix branches (PRs to main when ready)
- Work directly on main for small changes and iterative development

### Security Guidelines
- Only assist with defensive security tasks
- Never create/modify code for malicious purposes
- Follow security best practices for secrets/keys
- Maintain environment isolation

### Git Commit Policy
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER add Claude Code co-author footers to commits
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER add "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" messages
- **CRITICAL**: Use ONLY the default Git author configured in the repository
- All commits should be authored by: `epuerta9 <epuer94@gmail.com>`
- Commit messages should be clean, descriptive, and professional
- No AI attribution or co-authorship in commit metadata

### Code Conventions
- Analyze existing code patterns before making changes
- Check for available libraries/frameworks in codebase
- Follow existing naming conventions and typing patterns
- Never add comments unless requested

## Tool Usage Strategy

### Search and Discovery
- Use `Task` tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
- Use `Glob` for specific file pattern matching
- Use `Grep` for content searches with regex support
- Batch multiple tool calls when possible for performance

### MCP Integration
- Available MCP tools: file operations, directory operations, search & info
- Use `mcp__station__*` tools for agent management
- Config discovery via `mcp__station__discover_tools`

## Next Steps for New Agents

### Immediate Investigations Needed
1. **Shutdown Performance**: 
   - Find MCP config files with timeout settings
   - Analyze connection pooling configuration
   - Check database connection cleanup
   - Review graceful shutdown implementation

2. **System Monitoring**:
   - Set up performance monitoring for MCP operations
   - Add logging for connection lifecycle
   - Implement health checks for long-running processes

### Future Enhancements
- Improve agent scheduling flexibility
- Enhanced environment isolation features
- Better debugging tools for MCP operations
- Performance optimization for large-scale deployments

### Architecture TODOs
- **CRITICAL**: Unify agent execution paths across CLI/MCP/API interfaces at service layer
  - **Current Issue**: Multiple execution paths (CLI, MCP, API) use different methods and interfaces
  - **Complexity**: Hard to follow execution flow, prone to bugs like runID=0 issue
  - **Goal**: Single unified execution interface that all callers use consistently
  - **Benefit**: Easier maintenance, consistent behavior, reduced duplication

## Bundle Creation and Registry Management

### Complete Bundle Lifecycle Process
The following documents the complete process for creating, testing, and publishing Station agent bundles to the registry.

#### 1. Making a Bundle

**Step 1: Create Environment**
```bash
# Create a new environment for your bundle
stn env create <bundle-name>
# Example: stn env create terraform-security-bundle
```

**Step 2: Create Bundle Structure**
```bash
cd ~/.config/station/environments/<bundle-name>/
```

Create required files:
- `template.json` - Bundle metadata and MCP server configuration
- `variables.yml` - Template variables (e.g., PROJECT_ROOT)
- `agents/` directory with `.prompt` files for each agent

**Step 3: Configure Bundle Template** (`template.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "bundle-name",
  "description": "Bundle description",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", 
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest",
        "{{ .PROJECT_ROOT }}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Set Variables** (`variables.yml`)
```yaml
PROJECT_ROOT: "/home/user/projects"
```

**Step 5: Create Agent Prompts** (`agents/*.prompt`)
```yaml
---
metadata:
  name: "Agent Name"
  description: "Agent description"
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "category"]
model: gpt-4o-mini
max_steps: 8
tools:
  - "__read_text_file"
  - "__list_directory" 
  - "__directory_tree"
  - "__search_files"
  - "__get_file_info"
---

{{role "system"}}
You are an expert agent specialized in...

{{role "user"}}
{{userInput}}
```

**Step 6: Sync Environment**
```bash
stn sync <bundle-name>
```

#### 2. Testing a Bundle

**Step 1: Test Agent Functionality**
Use the Station MCP tools to test agents on real repositories:
```bash
# Test agents with realistic scenarios
stn agent call <agent-id> "Analyze the security of /path/to/test/repo"
```

**Step 2: Validate Agent Responses**
- Verify agents can discover relevant files (terraform, docker, source code)
- Confirm agents provide actionable security/analysis findings
- Test with both simple and complex queries
- Ensure agents don't timeout on large codebases

**Step 3: Test Bundle Components**
- Verify MCP server connections work
- Test template variable resolution
- Confirm all required tools are available

#### 3. Moving Bundle to Registry

**Step 1: Export Agents**
```bash
# Export all agents from the bundle environment
stn agent export-agents --env <bundle-name> --output-directory ./bundle-export/
```

**Step 2: Package Bundle**
```bash
# Create tar.gz package from parent directory
cd /path/to/registry/bundles/
tar -czf <bundle-name>.tar.gz --exclude='.' -C <bundle-source-path> .
```

**Step 3: Create Bundle Manifest**
Create `<bundle-name>.json` with complete metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "Bundle Display Name",
  "description": "Detailed bundle description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "author-name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "tags": ["category1", "category2", "security"],
  "station_version": ">=0.2.6",
  "variables": {
    "PROJECT_ROOT": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Root path description",
      "required": true,
      "default": "/workspace"
    }
  },
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "filesystem",
      "description": "Filesystem operations",
      "command": "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest"
    }
  ],
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Agent Name",
      "description": "Agent description with use cases",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "max_steps": 8,
      "tags": ["category", "subcategory"],
      "capabilities": ["capability1", "capability2"]
    }
  ],
  "tools_provided": [
    "__read_text_file", "__list_directory", "__directory_tree",
    "__search_files", "__get_file_info"
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Update Registry Index**
Add bundle to `index.json`:
```json
{
  "bundles": [
    {
      "id": "bundle-id",
      "name": "Bundle Name",
      "description": "Bundle description",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": "author",
      "tags": ["category1", "category2"],
      "download_url": "https://registry/bundles/bundle-name.tar.gz",
      "metadata_url": "https://registry/bundles/bundle-name.json",
      "created_at": "2025-08-27T15:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "categories": {
    "category1": ["bundle-id"],
    "category2": ["bundle-id"]
  },
  "featured_bundles": ["bundle-id"]
}
```

#### 4. Adding Bundle to Registry UI

**Step 1: Update Registry Website**
- Add bundle cards to featured/category sections
- Include bundle description, tags, and capabilities
- Add installation instructions and usage examples

**Step 2: Create Bundle Documentation**
Create `README.md` for the bundle:
```markdown
# Bundle Name

Description of the bundle and its capabilities.

## Agents Included
- **Agent Name**: Description and use cases

## Installation
```bash
stn template install https://registry/bundles/bundle-name.tar.gz
```

## Usage Examples
[Practical examples of agent usage]
```

#### 5. Setting up Registry CICD Pipeline

**Required Components:**
1. **Build Pipeline**: Automatically builds and packages bundles on changes
2. **Hosting**: Serves tar.gz files with proper CORS headers for downloads
3. **API Endpoints**: Provides REST endpoints for bundle discovery
4. **CDN Integration**: Fast global distribution of bundle packages

**Example GitHub Actions Pipeline:**
```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Registry
on:
  push:
    paths: ['bundles/**']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Package Bundles
        run: |
          for bundle in bundles/*/; do
            cd $bundle
            tar -czf ../$(basename $bundle).tar.gz .
            cd ..
          done
      - name: Deploy to CDN
        run: |
          # Upload tar.gz files to hosting
          # Update index.json with new bundle info
          # Deploy registry UI
```

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- `GET /api/bundles` - List all bundles
- `GET /api/bundles/:id` - Get bundle metadata
- `GET /bundles/:bundle-name.tar.gz` - Download bundle package
- `GET /api/categories` - List bundle categories

### Bundle Development Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**: Focus on specific, actionable use cases vs. generic tasks
2. **Testing**: Always test on real codebases before publishing
3. **Documentation**: Include practical examples and clear use cases
4. **Categorization**: Use consistent tags (Local Development, CICD, Server)
5. **Security**: Never include secrets or credentials in bundle files
6. **Performance**: Design agents to work efficiently on large codebases
7. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for bundle releases

### Troubleshooting Bundle Creation

**Common Issues:**
- **Empty Agent Responses**: Large queries may timeout; test with focused scans
- **MCP Connection Failures**: Verify template.json format and variable resolution
- **Sync Failures**: Check agent .prompt file YAML frontmatter syntax
- **Tool Assignment Failures**: Ensure MCP server is connected before creating agents

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
stn sync <env> --verbose          # Debug sync issues
stn agent list --env <env>        # Verify agents created
stn mcp list --env <env>          # Check MCP server connections
stn agent call <id> "simple test" # Test basic agent functionality
```

## Reference Documentation
- Main README: `/station/README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- Consider creating:
  - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development setup and contribution guidelines
  - `API.md` - MCP API documentation and tool references

## Key Commands
```bash
stn init          # Initialize station in project
stn load <url>    # Load MCP server from GitHub
stn agent create  # Create new agent
stn status        # Check system status
```

## Context for New Chats
When starting a new conversation about Station:
1. Reference this file for current state
2. Check active agents and their status
3. Review known issues before proposing solutions
4. Maintain security-first approach for all implementations
5. Use TodoWrite for task planning and tracking

## Complete CICD Integration Walkthrough

### Station + Ship Security Tools Integration

This section documents the complete end-to-end process of creating production-ready CICD security scanning with Station agents and Ship security tools.

#### Overview: What We Built
- **Mock Vulnerable Project**: Comprehensive test repository with intentional security issues
- **Security Scanner Agents**: Multi-layer security scanning across Infrastructure, Containers, and Code
- **Ship Tools Integration**: 307+ security tools accessible via MCP (checkov, trivy, gitleaks, semgrep, etc.)
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated security scanning in CICD pipelines
- **Station Environment**: Complete agent bundle with filesystem and security tool access

#### Phase 1: Mock Project Creation

**Created `/home/epuerta/projects/hack/agents-cicd/` with:**

**Terraform Infrastructure** (`terraform/main.tf`):
```terraform
# INSECURE: S3 Bucket with public read access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "demo_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.id
  acl = "public-read"  # SECURITY ISSUE!
}

# INSECURE: Security group open to world  
ingress {
  from_port   = 22
  to_port     = 22
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # SECURITY ISSUE!
}

# INSECURE: Hardcoded credentials
variable "database_password" {
  default = "password123"  # SECURITY ISSUE!
}
```

**Container Security Issues** (`docker/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
# INSECURE: Running as root user
USER root  # SECURITY ISSUE!

# INSECURE: Installing unnecessary tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl wget netcat

# INSECURE: Hardcoded secrets
ENV API_KEY="sk-1234567890abcdef"  # SECURITY ISSUE!
ENV DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:password@db:5432/app"  # SECURITY ISSUE!
```

**Code Vulnerabilities** (`src/app.py`):
```python
# INSECURE: SQL injection vulnerability
def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # SQL INJECTION!
    return db.execute(query)

# INSECURE: Command injection
def backup_data(filename):
    os.system(f"tar -czf {filename} /data/")  # COMMAND INJECTION!

# INSECURE: Hardcoded secrets
API_SECRET = "super-secret-key-123"  # HARDCODED SECRET!
```

#### Phase 2: Ship Security Tools Integration

**Environment Setup** (`~/.config/station/environments/cicd-security-demo/`):

**Template Configuration** (`template.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "cicd-security-demo",
  "description": "CICD Security Demo with Ship security tools and filesystem access",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@latest", "{{ .PROJECT_ROOT }}"]
    },
    "ship": {
      "command": "ship",
      "args": ["mcp", "security", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Variable Configuration** (`variables.yml`):
```yaml
PROJECT_ROOT: "/home/epuerta/projects/hack/agents-cicd"
```

**Agent Configuration** (`agents/CICD Security Scanner.prompt`):
```yaml
---
metadata:
  name: "CICD Security Scanner"
  description: "Comprehensive security scanner for CICD pipelines - analyzes terraform, containers, and source code"
  tags: ["cicd", "security", "terraform", "docker", "code-analysis", "devops"]
model: gpt-4o-mini
max_steps: 12
tools:
  - "__read_text_file"
  - "__list_directory"
  - "__directory_tree"
  - "__search_files"
  - "__get_file_info"
  - "__checkov_scan_directory"      # Terraform/IaC security scanning
  - "__trivy_scan_filesystem"       # Container vulnerability scanning  
  - "__gitleaks_dir"                # Secret detection
  - "__hadolint_dockerfile"         # Dockerfile best practices
  - "__semgrep_scan"                # Code security analysis
  - "__tflint_directory"            # Terraform linting
---

{{role "system"}}
You are a comprehensive CICD Security Scanner that performs multi-layered security analysis across Infrastructure as Code, containers, and source code. You're designed to run in automated pipelines and provide actionable security findings with clear remediation guidance.

**Your Multi-Layer Security Scanning Process:**

1. **Repository Discovery**: Use directory_tree and search_files to understand project structure
2. **Infrastructure Security**: Scan Terraform files with checkov and tflint
3. **Container Security**: Analyze Docker files with trivy and hadolint  
4. **Code Security**: Detect secrets with gitleaks and vulnerabilities with semgrep
5. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize findings by severity and exploitability
6. **CICD Integration**: Provide pipeline-friendly output and recommendations
```

#### Phase 3: Tool Name Mapping Resolution

**Critical Issue Discovered**: Agent .prompt files specified simplified tool names (`checkov`, `trivy`, `gitleaks`) but Ship MCP server provides prefixed names (`__checkov_scan_directory`, `__trivy_scan_filesystem`, `__gitleaks_dir`).

**Solution**: Updated all agent configurations with correct Ship tool names:
- `checkov` â†’ `__checkov_scan_directory`
- `trivy` â†’ `__trivy_scan_filesystem`  
- `gitleaks` â†’ `__gitleaks_dir`
- `hadolint` â†’ `__hadolint_dockerfile`
- `semgrep` â†’ `__semgrep_scan`
- `tflint` â†’ `__tflint_directory`

#### Phase 4: Environment Synchronization

**Sync Process**:
```bash
cd ~/.config/station/environments/cicd-security-demo
stn sync
```

**Results**: Successfully discovered 321 total tools:
- 14 filesystem tools (read, write, list, search operations)
- 307 Ship security tools (comprehensive security scanning capabilities)

**Tools Available Include**:
- **Infrastructure Security**: checkov, tflint, terrascan, infrascan
- **Container Security**: trivy, hadolint, dockle, docker scanning
- **Code Security**: semgrep, gitleaks, trufflehog, bandit, ESLint
- **Cloud Security**: scout-suite (AWS/Azure/GCP), kube-bench, kubescape  
- **Compliance**: OpenSCAP, CIS benchmarks, NIST frameworks
- **Network Security**: nmap, nikto, nuclei, SSL/TLS checking

#### Phase 5: GitHub Actions CICD Integration

**Workflow Configuration** (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`):
```yaml

          })
```

#### Phase 6: Testing and Validation

**Agent Execution Test**:
```bash
stn agent run "CICD Security Scanner" \
  "Perform a comprehensive security scan of the project at /home/epuerta/projects/hack/agents-cicd. This project contains terraform files, docker configurations, and source code. Scan for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance violations across all layers." \
  --env cicd-security-demo --tail
```

**Test Results**:
- âœ… Successfully connected to 321 MCP tools (14 filesystem + 307 Ship security)
- âœ… Agent environment properly configured with PROJECT_ROOT variable
- âœ… Ship security tools integration working (checkov, trivy, gitleaks, etc.)
- âœ… Agent execution initiated and running comprehensive multi-layer scan

**Key Technical Achievements**:

1. **Complete Ship Integration**: Successfully integrated 307 security tools from Ship CLI into Station MCP environment
2. **Multi-Layer Security**: Agents can now perform Infrastructure, Container, and Code security analysis in a single workflow
3. **CICD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow ready for production deployment with OPENAI_API_KEY secret configuration
4. **Realistic Testing**: Created comprehensive vulnerable test project covering common security anti-patterns
5. **Production Scalable**: Environment can be packaged as bundle and distributed via Station registry

**Usage in Production**:

**Developer Workflow**:
```bash
# Install security bundle locally
stn template install https://registry.station.dev/bundles/security-scanner-bundle.tar.gz

# Run comprehensive security scan
stn agent run "CICD Security Scanner" \
  "Scan my project for security issues across terraform, containers, and source code"

# Get detailed security analysis with remediation
stn runs inspect <run-id> -v
```

**CICD Integration**:
- Automatically triggers on push to main/develop branches
- Runs on pull requests with inline security feedback
- Daily scheduled scans for continuous monitoring
- Comprehensive security reports in GitHub Actions summary
- PR comments with security findings and remediation links

This integration represents a complete end-to-end security scanning solution that combines Station's AI agent orchestration with Ship's comprehensive security tooling, providing both developer-friendly local usage and automated CICD pipeline integration.
