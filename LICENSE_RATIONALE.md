# Why Station Uses AGPL-3.0

## Our Commitment to Open Source

Station is built by developers, for developers. We believe that powerful AI agent infrastructure should be **accessible to everyone** - from solo developers building side projects to small teams automating their workflows. The AGPL-3.0 license reflects our core values and ensures Station remains a thriving, sustainable open source project.

## What This Means for You

### ‚úÖ **Individual Developers & Teams**
- **Use Station completely free** for any purpose
- **Build commercial products** on top of Station
- **Deploy in your company** without restrictions
- **Modify the source code** to fit your needs
- **No license fees ever** for self-hosted deployments

### üè¢ **Enterprise Organizations** 
- **Full access to all features** for internal infrastructure
- **Commercial use is completely allowed** under AGPL-3.0
- **Option to purchase commercial licenses** for proprietary modifications
- **Enterprise support and cloud integration** available separately

## Why AGPL-3.0 Over Other Licenses?

### **Protecting Community Innovation**

We chose AGPL-3.0 because it ensures that improvements to Station benefit everyone. When companies modify Station to offer it as a hosted service, they must share those improvements back to the community - creating a virtuous cycle of innovation.

**The Problem with Permissive Licenses:**
Many excellent open source projects get "strip-mined" by large corporations who:
- Take the open source code
- Add proprietary features 
- Offer it as a competing cloud service
- Never contribute improvements back
- Undercut the original project's sustainability

### **Learning from Successful Projects**

We're following the proven path of projects that successfully balance open source principles with sustainable business models:

- **Grafana** (switched TO AGPL-3.0 in 2021) - now $300M+ ARR with thriving community
- **Nextcloud** (AGPL-3.0) - trusted by governments and enterprises worldwide
- **GitLab** (open core model) - successful IPO while maintaining strong open source presence

## Our Open Source Values

### **Community First**
- **All core functionality** remains open source forever
- **No bait-and-switch** - Station's agent management will always be free
- **Community feedback** drives our roadmap
- **Transparent development** on GitHub

### **No Vendor Lock-in**
- **Self-hosting is a first-class citizen** - you're never forced to use our cloud
- **Standard formats** for agent configurations and data export
- **Open APIs** for integrations and extensions
- **Full source code access** means you control your infrastructure

### **Sustainable Development**
- **Cloud services fund development** - enterprise customers enable us to improve the open source version
- **Fair partnership** with cloud providers who want to offer Station as a service
- **Long-term commitment** - licensing revenue ensures Station's continued development

## Common Misconceptions About AGPL

### **"AGPL is too restrictive for business use"**
‚ùå **False.** AGPL-3.0 is fully OSI-approved and allows all commercial use. The only requirement is sharing modifications if you offer Station as a network service.

### **"AGPL creates compliance burden"**
‚ùå **False.** For 99% of use cases (internal deployment, building products on top), there are zero additional compliance requirements beyond attribution.

### **"AGPL hurts adoption"**
‚ùå **False.** Grafana, Nextcloud, and countless other AGPL projects have massive communities and enterprise adoption.

## Our Dual Approach

### **Open Source Core (AGPL-3.0)**
- Complete AI agent management platform
- All MCP integrations and tool discovery
- Local execution and scheduling
- Configuration management and templates
- Web UI and CLI tools

### **Optional Commercial Services**
- **Cloud synchronization** - share agents across teams
- **Enterprise features** - SSO, audit logging, compliance reporting  
- **Managed hosting** - Station-as-a-Service
- **Priority support** - SLA-backed assistance
- **Custom integrations** - bespoke development services

## For Cloud Providers & Service Companies

We welcome partnerships with cloud providers who want to offer Station as a managed service. The AGPL-3.0 ensures a fair playing field:

- **Contribute improvements back** to benefit everyone
- **Purchase commercial licenses** for proprietary modifications
- **Partner with us directly** for co-developed features
- **Offer value-added services** around the open source core

This model has worked successfully for AWS + Grafana, various MongoDB partners, and many other open source companies.

## The Bottom Line

**AGPL-3.0 protects what you care about:**
- ‚úÖ Station stays open source forever
- ‚úÖ Solo developers and small teams use it free
- ‚úÖ Improvements benefit everyone
- ‚úÖ Sustainable funding for continued development
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in or rug-pulling

**While preventing what hurts open source:**
- ‚ùå Large corporations offering proprietary Station-as-a-Service without contributing back
- ‚ùå Strip-mining of open source work for private profit
- ‚ùå Fragmentation through closed-source forks
