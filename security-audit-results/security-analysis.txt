## üö® Critical Issues Found: 3
1. **Exposed API Key**  
   - **File**: `.env`  
   - **Line**: 5  
   - **Description**: Found an exposed API key for a third-party service.  
  
2. **Database Credentials**  
   - **File**: `config/database.yml`  
   - **Line**: 10  
   - **Description**: Found plaintext database user and password.  

3. **JWT Secret Key**  
   - **File**: `src/auth/config.js`  
   - **Line**: 15  
   - **Description**: Exposed JWT secret key that could be exploited for token generation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Issues Found: 2  
1. **Hardcoded SSH Key**  
   - **File**: `scripts/deploy.sh`  
   - **Line**: 8  
   - **Description**: Found a hardcoded SSH private key that could lead to unauthorized access.

2. **Unencrypted API Secret**  
   - **File**: `src/config.js`  
   - **Line**: 4  
   - **Description**: Unencrypted API secret found in code.

## ‚úÖ Security Checks Passed: 5
- No sensitive data exposed in version control for files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `src/index.js`
- All third-party libraries are up-to-date and checked against known vulnerabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Steps
1. **Remove Exposed API Keys**: Immediately remove exposed secrets from codebase.
   ```bash
   # Remove lines with sensitive data
   sed -i '5d' .env
   sed -i '10d' config/database.yml
   sed -i '15d' src/auth/config.js
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of committing them directly. Update your application configuration to read from these variables.
   ```javascript
   // Example to retrieve JWT Secret
   const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
   ```

3. **Implement Secret Management Tool**:  Use tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to manage secrets.
   
4. **Audit Deployment Scripts**: Review all deployment and automation scripts to ensure no secrets are hardcoded. Replace all instances with secure methods for injecting secrets at runtime.
   ```bash
   # Example of using SSH key through secure access:
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_secure_key user@server
   ```

5. **Regularly Scan Repositories**: Set up periodic scans using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipelines to prevent future exposures.
   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Action for gitleaks
   name: Gitleaks Scan
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     gitleaks:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run gitleaks
           uses: zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v1
           with:
             config: ./gitleaks.toml
   ```

By taking these actions, your repository can significantly enhance its security posture and mitigate the risk of incidents related to credential exposure.
